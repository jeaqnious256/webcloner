# webcloner
python website webcloner
 we first check if the length of sys.argv is less than 2. If it is, we print an error message and exit the script. Otherwise, we can safely access sys.argv[1] and proceed with cloning the website.

Make sure to provide a URL as a command-line argument when running your script. For example: python webcloner.py https://example.com
